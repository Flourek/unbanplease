# Unban Please

Accept or Deny the unban requests in your Twitch channel with style thanks to this faithful recreation of the Papers Please game.
Created for the streamer PSP1G. 

If you're looking to use this for your stream, please feel free to reach out to me. 

# Features
* Accept and Deny your Twitch unban requests as if it was Papers Please
* Localized entirely within your browser
* Access to all the relevant information about the ban, such as mod comments
* Freely drag all the papers around the screen
* Keybinds to speed up the process if needed 
* Stamp anywhere you want 
* Streamer Mode to hide user profile pictures
* Handwritten appearance of the unban appeals
* Censorship of all slurs and bigotry (eg. n-word becomes n***a)
* Freely select and copy text to follow any links
* Complete with many sound effects
* Stats to track how many appeals you accepted or denied

# Installation 
* Get Mozilla Firefox (currently doesn't work on Chrome)
* Make sure you're logged into Twitch
* In Firefox, install the extension [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
* Open this link https://flourek.github.io/unbanplease/injector.user.js
* Click "INSTALL"
* Edit the following link with your Twitch username <br> https://www.twitch.tv/popout/moderator/USERNAME/unban-requests?papers <br> and go to it. (notice the '?papers')

# Considerations
* The game is meant to be played at 1080p with the browser in fullscreen, you might experience bugs otherwise
* You can stamp as many times as you want, but it's only the last stamp that matters.
* The unban decision is sent to Twitch the moment you give the person a stamped "visa".
* If something is broken then try refreshing the page  :)
* The appeals are sorted by latest first.
